## What we’re about

**React.Indy** is a group located in Indianapolis, Indiana for anyone interested in React, React Native, React frameworks (like Next.js), JavaScript, TypeScript, or front-end engineering. It doesn't matter if you don't know anything about React, don’t use it every day, or are early in your web development career. **Everyone is welcome.**

All organizers and members of **React.Indy**, as well as any attendees of its events, are required to agree with the [code of conduct](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQf_7z4Ok-zyUY9vej4ZDafitByM6TOuZ8ju2rcEdEuKtuTYYrtDNjjw0EZRmt9pVQ2k7PqghYf16-F/pub).

The quick version: **React.Indy** is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of event participants or group members in any form.

## How to join

If you'd like to attend our _virtual_ meetings, please [the Meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/react-indy/). Meetup.com is where we started, and it's where we currently have our event calendar.

## Coming soon

Our first community project will be a website representing the group. The project is in the very early planning phase, and will be formally announced soon.
